## What is this? 

Three Tap Heroes is an extremely simple Gamebot for Telegram. You play as a team of Heroes trying to fend off hordes of monsters as they arrive. You are in control of a Mage (left), a Knight (center) and a Ranger (left). Monsters approach from above and you are supposed to command the hero corresponding to the frontmost enemy. If you get it right, the enemy is defeated and you get points. If you command the wrong hero, the other enemies will exploit that brief distraction and sprint briefly onward. If at any time a monster reaches your heroes, it's game over.
